A project taken up for the design practicum course is a project on computer-human 
interaction where a person can interact with the computing device through a 
characteristic color emitting pen and a projector to project the screen of the 
computing device on to any surface. Once projected, the surface can be used as a 
Touch Screen; all this was done at a cost as low as 100 IndianRs. Here is a short 
video of this product. This project also bagged first prize in open-house of the same course.
Here is a short-video that demonstrates basic features: <br>

Setup: A laser-tip I was holding in hand, projector, laptop with webcam made facing the red-light, an user who uses to manipulate with out impeding the line of sight of the camera.<br>
This project involves
<ul>
<li>
calibration for the transformation matrix between the projector coordinates and the camera coordinates.
</li>
<li>
laser-tip/red light detection and thresholding. 
</li>
<li>
once detected projects the projector coordinates onto the camera coordinates with calibration matrix.
</li>
<li>
Windows event triggering. 
</li>
</li>
</ul>
This software is also capable of recognising double clicks and is real-time, that one can use to draw over a scratch pad.
