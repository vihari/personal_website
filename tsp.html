What if we can transform the projector screen into a touch screen? 
A technology which goes by the name "Smartboards" enables the presenter to interact with the board but is extremely costly. 
This project is an attempt to enable the same but at a much lesser cost.<br>
The system only required a <i>computing device, webcam, a small laser light, projector</i> and <i>a flat surface for projection.</i> 
The system enables click, double-click, scroll and drawing.<br>
Below is the link to a short video that demonstrates the basic features of the system. Observe that the person in the video was interacting with the system from the projection surface. <br>

The project involved
<ul>
  <li>
    Calibration for the transformation matrix between the projector coordinates and the camera coordinates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Laser-tip/red light detection and thresholding. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Event (click, double-click e.t.c.) detection and triggering of the appropriate event.
