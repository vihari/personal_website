<a href='https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd' target='_blank'>ePADD</a> is a digital archival and collection tool. 
Similar to most of the tools that deal with unstructured content, Information Extraction tasks such as Entity Recognition and Linking are crucial for the software.
<br>
Supervised techniques for Named Entity Recognition (NER) suffer the domain adaptability problem. 
The problem of domain adaptability is acute in ePADD, since every archive is from a different domain. 
For more than a year now, I have researched on various solutions that can avoid this problem and can also preferably relax the other constraints of state-of-art NER techniques such as numerous coarse types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION) and scalability across languages.
<br>
<br>
We have adopted an approach similar to a rule-based system with the difference that the rules are automatically inferred during training. 
Also, the rules are patterns on the entities and do not look at the surrounding context of the entity. The system behaves like a human by inferring rules like <i>a place followed by "times" is a newspaper</i>, <i>any token followed by "malfunction" is most likely a disease</i>. 
Thousands of such rules for each of the fine-grained type are inferred from the gazette lists during training.<br> 
Since the rules are patterns on the entities, the recall is low as the single word entities and other variants of entities are missed. 
For this reason, we link all the proper nouns found in the corpus to each other and propagate the type to all the entities in a cluster. The above-described system is implemented and being tested out by the users.<br>
This work will be submitted to KDD'16.<br>
<br>
I have also implemented other NLP-related tasks in ePADD such as internal and external authority linking. The left image below shows a snapshot of internal authority linking, where an ambiguous name: <i>Peter</i> is expanded to an unambiguous name: <i>Peter Gizzi</i>; The right image shows the entity linking to external authority.<br>

This article summarise various experiments I have performed in
relation to the project.<br>
<p>
  Bspoke offers the following unique features.
<ul>
  <li> 
    It develops a rich and implicit user-profile by reading
    users' data on various platforms such as Facebook, Twitter,
    LinkedIn, Personal Websites, Emails, Browser History, and 
    personal documents (only Tika parsable documents are
    considered).
  </li>
  <li>
    It maintains a transparent user-profile and provides various 
    means to control this profile.
  </li>
  <li> 
    It is a client based system. Bspoke uses only local resources
    of the user and does not communicate with any other external server.
  </li>
  <li> 
    It is content based. In contrast to other popular 
    recommenders, which are mostly based on methods such as Collaborative 
    Filtering, Bspoke actually reads the content of the article to
    decide its relevance and also explains why the article could be
    interesting. 
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Bspoke has two major components
<ul>
<li>User profile</li>
<li>News sources</li>
</ul>
<h3>User profile</h3>
<p>
  What should a good user profile contain for a content based news
  recommender? <br>
  Bspoke represents user-profile as weighted term vector, this was also 
  the popular form of representation in the past, for example, in YourNews 
  system 
  (<a href='http://www.wwwconference.org/www2007/papers/paper602.pdf'>Ahn et al., 2007</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Can we automatically build a user-profile that is aware of every
  aspect of the person from work to entertainment related?<br>
  Bspoke considers users' data on different platforms as described
  above. It considers both free text and structured content (such
  as Likes, Location, etc. on Facebook) from these sources. Free text from
  these sources is processed to extract Singular Nouns and few
  filtered nouns, which are then added to the user-profile.
</p>
<p>
  How can we easily expand this profile?<br>
  User profile generated from these sources generally contains a few
  hundred terms, to automatically expand this profile Bspoke uses
  Wikipedia. Bspoke disambiguates terms in the user profile with Wikipedia 
  topics by a context
  match between the Wikipedia page and personal text. The context of a
  term from personal text
  contains <i>person</i>, <i>organisation</i>, and <i>geographical
  location</i>, type entities
  that the term co-occurred within the free text. The Wikipedia pages
  are further expanded, as explained below.
</p>
<p>
  Given a bunch of Wikipedia topics of interest, how to recognise
  other relevant topics?<br>
  <i>If one is interested in Stanford University and Google, then
  Sergey Brin and Larry Page could also be of interest.</i><br>
  Below is a sketch of various methods I have attempted.<br>
  <b>All the hyperlinks on a Wikipedia page</b>: The hyperlinks on a
  Wikipedia page need not all point to relevant topics. Because the
  content is human created, there can be many spurious references. For
  example <i>Harry Potter</i> Wikipedia page may point
  to <i>Chess</i>.
  <br> 
  <b>Symmetric hyperlinks on a Wikipedia page</b>: Only considering
  the links which are mutual gave better results. For example, in the
  above case, <i>Chess</i> is not considered relevant to <i>Harry
    Potter</i> because the <i>Chess</i> page does not have a link to 
  <i>Harry Potter</i>.
  <br>
  <b>PageRank over all the Wikipedia pages</b>: To rank the links
  on various pages, we performed Pagerank with seed pages as the
  Wikipedia pages of interest. We observed that the performance is no 
  better than the "symmetric hyperlinks" method above; the main reason
  being that the noisy terms (links) form a network of
  interconnections, which increase the rank of the noisy terms.
  <br> 
  Overall, method 2 above performed better.
</p>
<b>Recommendation</b><br>
An article is scored and recommended based on relevance score. 
Relevance score is computed by the dot product of weighted term
vector of user profile and weighted (based on TF-IDF) term vector of 
the article.  
</p>
<p>
  <h3>News sources</h3>
  Is there a single representative source of news?
<p>
  <b>Twitter</b><br>
  Bspoke soft follows few hashtags and users, which are
  explicitly specified by the user, on Twitter. News from Twitter filtered
  by hashtags served as a window into what's new in the world. In
  contrast to many other news recommenders that recommends content
  from various news sources, Twitter is more diverse and organic. Problems with
  such a system are as follows
  <ol>
    <li>
      Hashtags are human created and change at a rapid pace. People
      come up with different hashtags for the same event or
      topic. The quality of news is directly dependant on the hashtags
      chosen, they have to be diverse and fairly representative of one's
      interests, the rich user profile is of little use otherwise. 
      Discovering proper hashtags is in itself a very tough job.
    </li>
    <li>
      It takes even a computer (single-threaded process on 2.4GHZ
      processor) several hours to read enough number of tweets to
      suggest interesting news, that would otherwise be missed.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b>Try the software <a href='http://mobisocial.stanford.edu/bespoke/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</b><br>
  Professional journalists at Stanford University tested this version of the software. <br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>UI centric spin</b><br>
  Realising the difficulty in finding proper news sources, we explored
  other ways of using the profile. It is hard to find relevant
  information on some web pages such as NYTimes.com,
  washingtonpost.com, some News Aggregators, Google Search, etc. We
  built a Google Chrome Extension to re-render any
  web pages for easier content discovery and also serves as a quick
  summariser. On a web page, Bspoke tools
  collect and read all the links on the page to find any relevant
  information. On Google Search page, Bspoke reads results beyond 
  the first page to find relevant articles.<br>
