	  Guide: Dr. Arnav Bhavsar and Dr. Dileep A. D.
	  <br> 
	   I worked in a team of three to design a real-time algorithm capable of 3D reconstruction of small to medium scale objects on smart phones. <br>
	   I designed an algorithm similar to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrabCut'>GrabCut</a> to segment and track the target object. By identifying the target object in every frame, we reduced the required computation. We implemented the system described in <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/PTAM/">Parallel Tracking and Mapping (PTAM)</a> to track the camera and build the 3D structure of the environment. This was finally followed by point cloud registration and surface reconstruction to build the 3D model of the target object.

	  Guide: Dr. Sudheendra Hangal.
	  <br> 
	  Seaview is a log file visualization software to make the process of debugging with log files simpler with data visualization techniques.
	  Seaview depends on a program analysis tool called <a href="https://github.com/hangal/unifi">Unifi</a> to instrument the log. 
	  The log file so instrumented contains semantics of the variables in the log, which enables the various summarisation plots over the log.

	  Guide: Dr. Bharat Singh Rajpurohit, Dr. Suman Kalyan Pal.<br>
	  Around 2012, I built a prototype for a low cost smart board.
	  The system can transform any flat surface such as a black board into an interactive surface where it is possible to draw, click, double click and scroll with a charecteristic light emitting pen.
	  A camera tracks the position of the pen and transforms the position from camera coordinates to the projector coordinates through a calibration matrix. An appropriate event was then initiated over the transformed coordinates.

	  Guide: Prof. Hema Murthy<br>
	  As a final project of "Pattern Recognition", I developed an application to enable basic interaction with a computer such as changing/pausing music tracks.
	  It works by recognising static gestures through the webcam connected to the machine.
	  I have idetified five gestures of least confusion - highest accuracy and demonstrated a working system that worked 90% of the time.
	  I worked on various problems to develop the end to end pipeline such as skin color detection, guassian error denoising, convex hull detection (for data compression), K Means clustering followed by classification with SVM (Support Vector Machines) model.

	  Guide: Navneet Subramanian.<br>
	  I was briefly introduced to the domain of Medical Imaging during my internship with GE Global Research. 
	  I devised an algorithm to remove certain types of distortions from Ultra Sound (US) images which involved improvising on Frangi Vessel Detection and RANSAC based plane thresholding techniques.
	  For the major chunk of my time here, I worked on registration of US images in order to build the 3D model of the organ being scanned. I had success adapting the "Fast Point Feature histogram for 3d registration" to the task at hand.<br>

	  Guide: Dr.Anil Kumar Sao<br>
	  Around 2011-12, I led a team to build an Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (AUAV). Tracking of the vehicle was one of the most crucial and basic tasks to achieve autonomous navigation. 
	  We used a stereo camera rig to compute and supply us with the odometry information, we had adapted the system described "Andrew Howard, Real time visual odometry for Autonomous Ground vehicles" for this task. The odometry information is further fused with the information from other sensors with Kalman Filters.

<!--  <b>Blockit!</b> <br>
  Guide: <a href="http://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~tag/">Prof T.A.Gonsalves</a><br>
  The project was to make firewall rules to prevent DoS attack, only aggressive attacks were addressed and Low Rate DOS attack not considered. Our team came up with certain set of rules/algorithm which helped in mitigating the DoS attacks to a good extent.The firewall can be found <a href="docs/firewallconfig">here</a>.(This firewall rules are with iptables firewall of Linux distro.'s).

  <b>Wall Following Robot</b><br>
  A project aimed at making a small bot which can follow a wall and avoid some of the obstacles that comes in its way while following the wall. This was implemented with a PID controller and some sonar sensors.<br>
  The bot was to be present at IIT Bombay TechFest.
