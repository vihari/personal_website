	  Guide: Dr. Arnav Bhavsar and Dr. Dileep A. D.
	  <br> 
	   This is an ongoing project which aims to design a real-time algorithm capable of 3d reconstruction of any object on mobile camera phones. Various modules of the project are object segmentation, object tracking, camera tracking, point cloud extraction of the object, point cloud registration and surface reconstruction. Object segmentation and object tracking modules are thorough, with some lags in tracking modules. Camera tracking from mobile sensor reading i.e. gyros and accelorometers alone is awful and system similar to <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/PTAM/">PTAM</a> must be used inorder to improve on the results.

	  Seaview is a log file visualization software. The objective of the software is to aid the programmer in debugging, by aiding the visualization of log files. 
	  The java byte code shall be instrumented with <a href="https://github.com/hangal/unifi">Unifi</a> to infer unites and dimensions of various variables across class files. Instrumentation step also replaces the log statements that dump also the identity of the variable along with log.

	  Guide: Dr. Bharat Singh Rajpurohit, Dr. Suman Kalyan Pal.<br>
	  A project taken up for the design practicum course is a project on computer-human 
	  interaction where a person can interact with the computing device through a 
	  characteristic color emitting pen and a projector to project the screen of the 
	  computing device on to any surface. Once projected, the surface can be used as Touch Screen; all this was done at a cost as low as 100 IndianRs. This project also bagged first prize in open-house of the same course.

	  Guide: Prof. Hema Murthy<br>
	  Gesture recognition from webcam images with SVM.
	  5 gestures with least confusion and highest accuracy were recognised and isolated.
	  This involved frames procurement -> skin color detection -> guassian error denoising -> convex hull detection(for data compression) -> K Means clustering -> SVM(support vector machines).
	  Accuracy close to 90% was observed with the least confusion set of gestures.

  <b>Blockit!</b> <br>
  Guide: <a href="http://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~tag/">Prof T.A.Gonsalves</a><br>
  The project was to make firewall rules to prevent DoS attack, only aggressive attacks were addressed and Low Rate DOS attack not considered. Our team came up with certain set of rules/algorithm which helped in mitigating the DoS attacks to a good extent.The firewall can be found <a href="docs/firewallconfig">here</a>.(This firewall rules are with iptables firewall of Linux distro.'s).

  <b>Wall Following Robot</b><br>
  A project aimed at making a small bot which can follow a wall and avoid some of the obstacles that comes in its way while following the wall. This was implemented with a PID controller and some sonar sensors.<br>
  The bot was to be present at IIT Bombay TechFest.
