<strong>Visual Odometry</strong>
<br>
This project was a part of AUAV[Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle project]. 
Visual Odometry is a problem of pose estimation of the vehicle from its video-feed. This project was an application of "Andrew Howard, Real time visual odometry for Autonomous Ground vehicles." <br>
Pose estimation was done with two different sensors namely Microsoft Kinect and Stereo camera rig.<br>
Microsoft Kinect's algorithm is slightly different from Stereo camera counter-part. <br>
<a href="https://www.academia.edu/2212391/Autonomous_Navigation_in_GPS_Denied_Indoor_Environment_Using_RGBD_Sensor_Kinect">This</a> paper briefs further the algorithm and results. <br>
Here is a video that demonstrates the software on a dataset:<br>
