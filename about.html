  I was born in Bhimavaram, Andhra Pradesh in 1993. Apt with my Name Vihari(Roamer, derived from Krishna), I never stayed in one place. I roamed in many parts of India since my birth, I have been through the bredth of India from Himachal Pradesh to Bangalore and Calcutta to Bombay. I love science fiction(Iron man, Star trek, Batman, Terminator and so on), I also like to read Dan Brown novels. Contrary to my work of computer science, I would also like to put myself fit and hence do casual trekkings. I also like to run, I will someday run a full marathon. 
  <p>
  In free time I write scripts to ease my routine tasks like downloading songs(not the itune ones, but regional ones), ethical and careful hacking, read all of Stephen Hawking books, Watch discover, Science channels, watch some T.V series(big bang theory being my favourite), listen songs(almost always).
