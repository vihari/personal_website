<p>I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi with major in Computer Science, in 2014. My interests include Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. 
I am passionate about building things with scope for impact. I love coding, hacking, maths, and enjoy Indian Classical art forms.</p> 
<p>I have worked on diverse projects ranging from 3d-printer to Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (AUAV).</p>
<p>I look forward to obtaining the higher degree(s) in my career and hope to enrol in a school shortly. I believe my time in academic pursuit will help me meet other like-minded people and expose me to bigger problems.</p>
<p> My hobbies include Badminton, Volleyball, Trekking, Running, playing flute and traveling. </p>
