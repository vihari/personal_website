<p>I just(2014) graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi with majors in Computer Science. I work on problems related to Information Extraction, Social computing, Machine learning and Computer Vision. I have a passion for building things, especially if it has scope for big-impact in a good way. I love Programming, Mathematics, Physics and a very recent passion; Instrumental-music.</p> 
<p>I have worked on diverse projects ranging from 3d-printer, Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(AUAV) to Bspoke and ePADD.  </p>
<p>I look forward to obtain higher degree(s) in my career and will be applying for few upniversities this fall. I believe my time in academic persuit can help me meet other like-minded people and expose me to bigger problems.</p>
<p> My hobbies include playing Badminton and Volleyball, Trekking, Running, playing flute and hunting for good food. </p>
